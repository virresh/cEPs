# Abstract

This document describes how an API based on ANTLR will be constructed and
maintained.

# Introduction

ANTLR provides parsers for various language grammars and thus we can provide
an interface from within coala and make it available to bear writers so that
they can write advanced linting bears. This will aim at supporting the more
flexible visitor based method of AST traversal (as opposed to listener based
mechanisms).

The proposal is to introduce a paralled concept to the coala-bears library,
which will be called the coala-ast hereon.

# Proposed Change

Here is the detailed implementation stepwise:

1. There will be a separate repository named as coala-ast which will be
installable via ```pip install coala-ast```.
2. A new interface would be introduced in coala-core (```coala/coalib```),
which would be the new ast package. This would be the ```coalib.ast``` package
3. The ```coalib.ast``` package will provide endpoints relevant to the visitor
model of traversing the ast generated via ANTLR.
4. The coala-ast repository will hold parser generated (with python targe)
beforehand for the supported set of grammars.
5. ```coalib.ast``` will have an AST loader class that will be responsible for
loading the AST of a given file depending on the extension.
For e.g, a .c file will be loaded using the parser from ```coala-ast``` for c
language.
6. Another AST walker class will be responsible for providing endpoints for
traversing the AST using methods such as ```get_next_node``` and
```get_previous_node```.

# Management of the new ```coala-ast``` repository

Managing a new repository is a heavy task, and this will be highly automated as
follows:

1. The parsers in coala-ast would be generated and pushed via travis-builds
whenever a new grammar is pushed.
2. The cib tool can be enhanced to deal with the installation of bears that
require only some specified parsers (for e.g a PyUnusedVarBear would only
require parser for python)
3. The cib tool can also trigger specialised builds and download the newly
generated parser on the fly

# Code Samples/Prototypes
Here is a prototype for the implementations within coalib.ast:

```python
import parsers
import antlr4

class ASTLoader():
    lexerMapping = {
        'c' : parser.clexer,
        'py' : parser.pylexer,
        'js' : parser.jslexer,
        ...
    }
    parserMapping = {
        'c' : parser.cparser,
        'py' : parser.pyparser,
        'js' : parser.jsparser,
        ...
    }

    @staticmethod
    def loadFile(file,filename):
        """ Loads file's AST into memory """
        ext = get_extension(filename)
        if ext is None:
            raise FileExtensionNotSupported
        inputStream = file.readlines()
        lexer = lexerMapping[ext](inputStream)
        parser = parserMapping[ext](lexer)
        return parser

class ASTWalker():
    treeRoot = None
    tree = None
    def __init__(file,filename):
        self.tree = ASTLoader.load(file, filename)
        self.treeRoot = self.tree

    def get_next_node(self):
        """ Modify the internal tree variable and return the next node """

    def get_prev_node(self):
        """ Modify the internal tree variable and return prev node """

    def reset(self):
        """ Reset the internal tree variable to tree root """

    def isTerminalNode(node):
        """ Determine if the node is terminal """
        return isinstance(node, antlr4.tree.Tree.TerminalNode)

    ...

```


### Prototype of  `ASTBear` class implementation:

```python
from coalib.bears.LocalBear import Bear
from coalaib.ast import ASTWalker

class ASTBear(LocalBear):
    walker = None

    def initialise(file, filename):
        walker = ASTWalker(file, filename)

    def run(self,
            filename,
            file,
            tree,
            *args,
            dependency_results=None,
            **kwargs):
        raise NotImplementedError           # Needs to be done by bear

```

A test bear:

```python
from coalib.results.Result import Result
from coalib.bears.ASTBear import ASTBear

class TestBear(ASTBear):
    def run(self,
            filename,
            file,
            tree,
            *args,
            dependency_results=None,
            **kwargs):
        self.initialise(file, filename)
        num_nodes = 0
        while(tree.get_next_node() != None):
            num_nodes += 1
        yield Result(self, 'File {} has {} nodes '
                           ' in AST.'.format(filename, num_nodes))

```
